# Zoodle
## An ambitious wordle clone

### File structure
dictionary.js - A list of words that will be accepted as viable guesses <br>
index.html - Dictates the elements that appear on screen <br>
script.js - controls the back end logic of the app <br>
styles.css - controls how the elements and the page actually look <br>
targetWords.json - A list of words that will actually be used as answers <br>

### Description

With this project, I am trying to create a clone of wordle. <br>

This project has been built using only basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. <br>

As it is a single page application, I did not feel the need to impliment any additional frameworks. <br>

The basic idea will be that it should function just as Wordle does but with the twist that all of the acceptable answers will be animals.
